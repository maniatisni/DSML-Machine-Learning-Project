# DSML-Machine-Learning-Project
Team 75 Project: Regression - Convolutional Neural Networks  
Datasets: S12, B04  
Team Seed for CIFAR-dataset: C=119

 - 1st Part (Dataset A) contains the notebook with the Exploratory Data Analysis and the mutliple experiments with the different kinds of regressors, regarding dataset **S12**. The dataset itself for this notebook can be found under /datasets/airfoil_self_noise.dat (more information https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Airfoil+Self-Noise)

 - 1st Part (Dataset B) contains the notebook with the Exploratory Data Analysis and the mutliple experiments with the different kinds of regressors, regarding dataset **B04**. In this dataset there are multiple targets to be predicted so sklearn's MultiOutputRegressor was utilised. The dataset itself for this notebook can be found under /datasets/data.txt (more information https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Condition+Based+Maintenance+of+Naval+Propulsion+Plants)
